# eLibrary

eLibrary is simple book manager.

The main page of the application implements a predefined list of books that can be filtered from a search box. The selection of a book in the list shows the book's details. To each book in the list is associated a dropdown menu that allows to update the book's details or delete it from the list. A button in the main mask allows to add new books to the list. The Add and Edit Forms are implemented with modal windows that appear over the main window.
